__*All colorschemes are now free as of Insomnia 6.0*__ &#128079;

It's now been more than two years since leaving my full-time job to work on Insomnia 🙌. Today, Insomnia remains a 
single-person company, although product development is now assisted by a growing community of 
[30+ open-source contributors](https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia/graphs/contributors). I couldn't be happier
by the overwhelming support and positivity that I see every day. 💕

As shown on the [Transparency Page](/transparency), growth isn't slowing down. Annual recurring revenue 
recently passed **$100,000** and continues to climb 📈. Not only is this an impressive number but it also marks a
significant point in time: **Insomnia is now sustainable**! This means that growth no longer has to be the
number one priority.

Now that growth has less priority, it's time to start giving back. As of version 6.0, 
**premium themes no longer require a paid subscription to use**. 🎉 And, as Insomnia continues to grow, 
I hope to be able to give even more back to this great community. 

Thanks so much to the 600+ people who have signed up for a paid plan, to everyone who's contributed to the
project, and to the hundreds of thousands of people who have used Insomnia over it's lifetime. It wouldn't
be able to succeed without you. 😍💕
