One of my goals when starting Insomnia was to share as much about the process as possible. 
The first step towards that goal was publishing a monthly [transparency report](/series/transparency/)
outlining growth, mistakes, successes, and general thoughts. 

This page is the
next attempt at sharing even more. It's fairly basic right now, but I plan to add more numbers
here as time goes on. If you have any suggestions for things you want to see, just 
[send an email](/documentation/support-and-feedback/) and let me know.
