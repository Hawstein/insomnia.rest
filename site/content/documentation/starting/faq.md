Here are answers to the most frequently asked questions that I receive from
email support and social media.

## General Questions

**What platforms does Insomnia run on?**<br>
Insomnia has desktop apps for 64-bit versions of Mac, Windows, and Linux. 

**Does Insomnia provide 32-bit binaries?**<br>
At this time, Insomnia is 64-bit only.

**Can I use Insomnia for commercial use?**<br>
Yes, of course!

**How can I support Insomnia?**<br>
First of all, thank you! Since Insomnia is just starting out, the best thing you
can do is help spread the word! You can also submit bug reports, let me know
how you use Insomnia, or sign up for a [paid plan](/pricing).


## Technical Questions

**How can I set an environment variable from a request?**<br>
At this time, that is not possible, but it's coming soon.

**How can I temporarily disable Nunjucks template?**<br>
You can disable templating of the request body via the request settings dialog 
(accessed from the sidebar). For more control, you can also disable templating by 
wrapping the desired content in the 
[Nunjucks {% raw %} Tag](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#raw).

**Why don't I see anything after importing a backup?**<br>
The import/export feature acts similarly to copying files in a filesystem. If
the import contains data that originated from your application, data will be
overwritten. However, if the import contains data that did not originate from 
your application, new data (including workspaces) may have be created.<br>
 _Hint: You can check for newly created Workspaces in the main (top-left) 
 dropdown._

**Where does the application store data?**<br>
Insomnia stores data in Electron's [`appData`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/app.md#appgetpathname)
directory, which is differs depending on platform. The local database is distributed across
files with the name `insomnia.${resourceName}.db`.

- `%APPDATA%` on Windows
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `~/.config` on Linux
- `~/Library/Application` Support on macOS

## Random Questions

[ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and

[NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb).

**How can I donate?**<br>
Even though Insomnia has paid plans, a handful of people have emailed about 
donations. You can donate via PayPal on my 
[PayPal.me](https://www.paypal.me/gschier) page.
