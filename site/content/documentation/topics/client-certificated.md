[Client certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_certificate) are used by some
APIs to as a way for the client to authenticate itself.

## Importing Certificates

Insomnia supports `PFX` (Mac), and `PEM` (Windows and Linux) certificates. To import a new certificate,
open the Workspace Settings dialog – accessible from the top-left menu – and click on the
Client Certificates tab. From here, you can add new certificates and view existing ones.

Now lets walk through how to import one.

If you're familiar with client certificates, the only field needing explanation should be
the `Host` field.

- `Host`: certificate will be sent when the host (and port if specified) matches 
- `PFX`: certificate in `PFX` or `PKCS12` format (Only supported on Mac)
- `CRT File` + `Key File`: certificate and key pair (only supported on Windows and Linux)
- `Passphrase`: An optional passphrase for the certificate if required

After importing a certificate, it will show up in the main certificates list. From here, it
can be enabled/disabled or deleted.
