This is currently an experimental feature
</p>

Insomnia provides the ability to reference response values of other requests. Select
**Response â‡’ Body** from the auto-completed tags.

To help explain request chaining, here are some common use-cases:

- use `token` from login response as an `Authorization` header
- use `id` from `POST /item` in `PUT /items/<id>`
