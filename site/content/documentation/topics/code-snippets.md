Insomnia can generate code for over twelve different languages. To do this, click on the 
_Generate Code_ button from the dropdown beside the request in the sidebar. From here, choose 
the language and library you want, then copy the snippet into your codebase.

_Code snippets are generated by 
[github.com/Mashape/httpsnippet](https://github.com/Mashape/httpsnippet)_.
