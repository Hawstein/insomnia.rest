Insomnia was initially built by me, [Gregory Schier](http://schier.co), but is now
an open source project. 

## Join The Discussion

Since the Insomnia community is still small, your suggestions and feedback go a long way.

Join the free-form discussion in the [Slack Group](https://chat.insomnia.rest) or post a more
formal request/bug via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia/issues). Everyone
is welcome, so don't by shy. &#x1f917;

## Tell Your Friends

Insomnia's user base is growing every month. However, it is still relatively small.
This means that almost anything you do _will_ have an impact. Here are few quick things
you can do to help:

- share Insomnia on social media (Twitter, Facebook, Google+)
- write a blog post about Insomnia
- tell your co-workers
- [buy a sticker](https://www.stickermule.com/ca/marketplace/8122-insomnia-rest-client)
