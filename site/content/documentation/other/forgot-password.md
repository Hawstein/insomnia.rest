<p class="notice info">
If you know your password, but want to change it, login to your account and change your
password from the <a href="/app/change-password/">Web Interface</a>.
</p>

For your security, your Insomnia password is:

- never transmitted over the Internet
- never logged locally
- never known to us at Insomnia
- only known to you
- the only way to decrypt your data

This ensures that your data is safe from intruders, but it also means that no one 
can reset your password.

_Read more about how your data is protected in the 
[Security Overview](/documentation/security/)._

In the case that you've tried all the passwords you can think of and still cannot login, contact
[mailto:support@insomnia.rest](support@insomnia.rest) with the email you used to sign up
and I will walk you through the process of creating a new account and transferring any
data (eg. billing details) necessary.
